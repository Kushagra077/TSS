12. First information contents:

      A written complaint dated 05.05.2023 signed by Shri Asim Kumar Pal, Deputy General Manager, Union Bank of India, Regional Office, Bangalore South,
      32nd E Cross Road, 4th T Block East, Pattabhirama Nagar, Jayanagar, Bengaluru- 560041 has been received in this office on 08.05.2023. The same
      has been taken as a part of FIR, which is enclosed.

      The allegations in brief is that Shri N Shivaprasad & Smt Uma Prasad has availed a rent loan of Rs.20 Crore from Union Bank of India on 02.09.2016
      against the lease rent discounting from M/s Royal Concorde International School run by M/s Royal Concorde Educational Trust.

      The said credit facility was secured by mortgage of immovable property situated at 3/2 of Ambalipura Village, Varthur Hobli, Bangalore South,
      Sarjapura, Bangalore jointly owned by Shri Shivaparad and Smt Uma Prasad and the same was registered with SRO Shivajinagar, Bangalore. The
      property was valued at Rs. 38.72 crores vide valuation report dated 25.07.2016 of M/s Sri Sai Group and Rs.38.89 crores vide valuation report dated
      22.07.2016 of Shri N Venkatesh.

      Subsequently due to default in repayments of loan, the credit facility was classified as NPA on 01.01.2018. The bank initiated recovery action against
      the borrowers by filing application in DRT. The orders were issued by DRT.

      During the recovery proceedings, the bank received a legal notice on 26.02.2019 from advocate Shri K S Naga Reddy on behalf of M/s Karnataka
      Kavery Educational & Cultural Trust from whom the borrower has purchased the said property wherein they have informed the bank about a suit filed
      against Shri Shivaprasad and Smt Uma Prasad wherein there is an interim order dated 04.07.2015 from IX Addl. City Civil and Sessions judge at
      Bangalore restraining them from alienating the property. As per the said notice given by the society, they have executed the sale deed in favour of
      borrowers on 23.02.2015 and the sale consideration was not fully paid to society by Shri Shivaprasad and Smt Uma Prasad.

      The civil suit O.S. No.5845/2015 was filed by M/s Karnataka Kaveri Education & Cultural Trust before IX Addl. City Civil and Sessions judge at
      Bangalore against the borrowers to set aside the sale deed executed by them. In the said suit, the Hon'ble court vide its interim orders dated
      04.07.2015 restrained the borrowers from alienating, encumbering and creating third party rights over the immovable property which was
      mortgaged with the bank. Despite the said order, the borrowers fraudulently created charge in favour of the bank and availed the credit facility by
      concealing the fact.

      The complaint further alleges that, a part of the said mortgaged property was already mortgaged by M/s Karnataka Kaveri Education & Cultural trust
      in favour of M/s K12 Techno Services Limited. It is alleged in the complaint that, the borrower and M/s Karnataka Kaveri Education & Cultural Trust
      have manipulated the EC whereas the actual EC clearly shows the charge created in favour of M/s. K12 Techno Services Limited.

      The complainant bank alleges that, the borrower conspired with M/s. Karnataka Kaveri Education & Cultural Trust and unknown private persons and
      public servants and defrauded bank by entering into a sale deed in respect of already encumbered property, and fraudulently inducing the Bank to
      sanction credit facility thereby causing wrongful loss of Rs.32,71,43,124/- as on 30.04.2023 to the UBI Bank and wrongful gain for themselves. The
      account was declared as fraud on 29.04.2022.

      The allegations leveled in the complaint, prima-facie discloses commission of cognizable offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal
      misconduct by the above named accused persons, unknown public servants and unknown others which are punishable u/s. 120-B r/w 420 of IPC and
      Section 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of PC Act, 1988. Hence the FIR.
