Reporter: “How did your meeting go, sir?” “It went well. A few more things to work out, but it went well.” Reporter: “Do you think you’ll have a plan before Wednesday?” “By the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors.” Reporter: “Do you want a plan — a deal by the time you leave for COP?” “Yes.” Reporter: “Is that something you’ve expressed to Democrats?” “That’s my hope.” Reporter: “Do you expect a vote this week?” “What do you think? I don’t know.” Reporter: “We’re asking you.” Reporter: “Are you concerned that you have to leave without your —?” “It’d be very, very positive to get it done before the trip. Thank you.” Reporters: “Thank you.” President Biden and Democratic congressional leaders hope to reach an agreement with centrist holdouts on the sprawling domestic policy plan before Mr. Biden departs for a climate conference in Glasgow. Credit Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times\n",

            "President Biden and Democratic congressional leaders raced Monday to strike a compromise on a sprawling domestic policy plan, pushing for a vote within days even as key sticking points remained on health care benefits, paid leave and how to pay for the package.\n",
            "\n",
            "The White House and top Democrats hope to reach an accord with centrist holdouts before Mr. Biden departs for a United Nations climate conference in Glasgow that begins on Sunday. He plans to push for a stronger international response to counter global warming and climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Biden told reporters that he was aiming for a deal on the package before his trip, which is scheduled to begin Thursday in Rome ahead of the Group of 20 economic summit.\n",
            "\n",
            "“That’s my hope,” he said Monday as he left for New Jersey to promote the social safety net, climate and tax increase package, expected to cost up to $2 trillion.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It would be very, very positive to get it done before the trip,” he added.\n",
            "\n",
            "Democrats are also facing time pressure to approve a $1 trillion, Senate-passed bipartisan infrastructure bill whose fate is tied to the broader domestic policy bill. Enacting it could hand the party a popular legislative achievement days before elections for governor in Virginia and New Jersey on Nov. 2. It would also renew a series of transportation programs that are set to lapse on Sunday, and whose expiration would result in furloughs for nearly 4,000 federal workers.\n",
            "\n",
            "On Monday afternoon, Mr. Biden traveled to Newark to make the case that the bipartisan bill would increase American competitiveness and help commuters by fixing aging transportation infrastructure like New Jersey’s Portal Bridge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Liberals have refused to vote for the infrastructure measure until a deal is reached on the far more expansive package, despite mounting pressure from their centrist colleagues.\n",
            "\n",
            "A number of disagreements remain over the details of the larger plan, which faces unified Republican opposition and must draw the support of every Democratic senator and nearly every member of the party in the House.\n",
            "\n",
            "“No one ever said passing transformational legislation like this would be easy, but we are on track to get this done,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader. “The progress of last week illustrated if you stick together and work toward finding that legislative sweet spot, then we can get big things done.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Biden met over the weekend with Mr. Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a crucial holdout who has pressed to keep the package to no more than $1.5 trillion, even as the president and other Democrats have worked to nudge the price tag higher. They are also discussing how to beef up climate provisions in the legislation after Mr. Manchin, a longtime defender of his state’s coal industry, rejected a $150 billion clean electricity program that had been the core of the plan’s bid to reduce emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Manchin is also among the lawmakers who have questioned a liberal push — led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the chairman of the Budget Committee — to expand Medicare to include dental, vision and hearing benefits. At a CNN town hall last week, Mr. Biden floated an $800 voucher to help accommodate that push. Democrats are also haggling over the duration and details of a Medicaid expansion, a new paid leave program and an extension of expanded payments for families with children.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Manchin expressed reservations about expanding Medicare without addressing the program’s financial stability, telling reporters, “If we’re not being fiscally responsible, that’s really concerning.”\n",
            "\n",
            "He also expressed concerns about an effort to cover the full expansion of health care for the dozen states whose leaders have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n",
            "\n",
            "States that already expanded Medicaid pay 10 percent of the cost of the expansion, and Mr. Manchin said he felt it would be unfair for the federal government to cover the entire cost for others, in essence rewarding states for holding out. Because of a 2012 Supreme Court ruling, Congress cannot force the holdout states to pay 10 percent of the bill.\n",
            "\n",
            "Negotiators are also still hammering out how to pay for the package. Because Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another Democratic holdout, has rejected increases to corporate and individual tax rates, negotiators are discussing an array of alternatives, including strengthening the I.R.S.’s ability to collect unpaid taxes, a wealth tax on America’s billionaires, a global corporate minimum tax and a tax on what corporations report to shareholders.\n",

After the incident, the assailant has also been shifted to the hospital for treatment after drinking Phenyl. On being informed about the incident, Thorala police rushed to the hospital. Inquiring the seriously wounded old Heeraben, the son's daughter had been molested two and a half years earlier by Keval. A complaint was lodged with the university police about the incident. The case was pending in court on Tuesday. After proving his attendance, he himself came home. Meanwhile, Keval and his mother Parul both came to him when he was going near the house to invite his husband for dinner last night. And why you don't want to settle with us, you quarreled saying that you have settled. At this time the matter was further complicated as the husband also rushed to her. Keval and her mother beat the husband. Later, Kewal took out a knife from his pant pocket and attacked himself, injuring himself in the chest, the mother and son escaped. After that, the old man said that he was shifted to the hospital for treatment. On the other hand, Keval has also been harassing Heeraben and his family for the rape incident, saying that he himself had taken phenyl and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. The Thorala police have registered a case against the mother and son on the complaint of Hiraben.\"\n",
